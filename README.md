# ProgramX Courses
Live site project link: [Bicycle Emporium]( https://the-tann-mann-gaadi-task.web.app/)

### Project Overview:
* Users must log in to access the video tutorials. 
* If one does not have an account, they must register and create an account. 
* User will be redirected to the course tutorials page after login/registration. 
* That page contains course names and tutorial videos. 
* If one clicks on any course video the user will be redirected to a new page and the video will play. I have used dynamic routing. 
* Iâ€™ve used firebase authentication for login/registration and for frontend HTML, CSS, React,js, React-Bootstrap , React-Router-Dom, React-Fontawesome are used.

As I had some extra time, I added some extra features to this project. These are: 
* I have used Context API, Private Route, Dynamic Routing
* User can log in with google and Facebook. 
* For security, I've used the environment variable for firebase. 
* If the routing URL is wrong then the user will be redirected to the not found page. 
* On the registration page if one uses an already existing email or password then an alert will be shown. 
* Also If a user types a wrong password or email while logging in then an alert will be shown. This validation has been done in this project. 
* When login or registration is done an alert will be notified.  
* After login, the log-out button will be shown in the navigation bar. Users will be redirected to the login page when they log out. 
* I've used the hover effect on images and icons.
* Max length was used for every input field.
